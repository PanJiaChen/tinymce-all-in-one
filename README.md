# Why

Now tinymce's cdn, all plugins are downloaded separately, but there are dozens of plugins. So the init is very slow. Therefore, this project will build all plugins into `tinymce.min.js` through [Offical Build](https://www.tiny.cloud/get-tiny/custom-builds/), speeding up the init speed. Didn't do anything else.

# Use

 Cnd in [jsdelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/package/npm/tinymce-all-in-one)

**If you don't mind the init speed, it is recommended to use the official [cdn](https://www.jsdelivr.com/package/npm/tinymce).**
