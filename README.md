# Why

Now tinymce's cdn is downloaded separately, but there are dozens of plugins. So the initialization is very slow. Therefore, this project will package all plugins into tinymce.min.js through [Offical Build](https://www.tiny.cloud/get-tiny/custom-builds/), speeding up the initialization. Didn't do anything else

# Use
